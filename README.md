# Markovitz teory for stock exchange portfolio

I created an application to create an optimal investment portfolio for selected company shares based on share value data from the Polish stock exchange- GPW. The application is based on Markovitz's theory. Tools of this type are used by investment funds.


(Django, Pandas, Rest API, data processing, database operations, datascience, AWS deploy)

I optimized the costs of the AWS server, I set an instance operation schedule. (AWS lambda, EventBridge, IAM roles and policies)


The instance is enabled from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. CET, Monday to Friday.
